# JUNY (Duolingo-Link Investment Application)

Juny is an investment learning application where users can learn about investing strategies through its curriculumn. This is a remodel of the previous Juny website and I am working hard to migrate all the curriculumn over for users.
I am also implementing a paper trading system where users can trade stocks with virtual money to test their investment strategies.
