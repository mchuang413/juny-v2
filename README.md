# JUNY (Duolingo-Link Investment Application) [https://www.junyapp.com/]

Juny is an investment learning application where users can learn about investing strategies through its curriculumn. This is a remodel of the previous Juny website and I am working hard to migrate all the curriculumn over for users.
I am also implementing a paper trading system where users can trade stocks with virtual money to test their investment strategies.

# Upcoming Features
As we continue to grow, we're planning to expand Juny to mobile platforms for both iOS and Android. Our goal is to build upon our existing platform, offering users a seamless learning experience whether theyâ€™re on desktop or on the go. Stay tuned for updates!
